# fishsense-optics-simulator 

The current FishSense system utilizes a corrective optic to prevent the distortion
of images that would otherwise occur with a flat port underwater enclosure.
Such distortion occurs when light refracts at the interfaces of the air, flat port
(acrylic), and water. The purpose of this optics simulator is to mathematically
and graphically model how underwater points in 3D space are being distorted
in our images, and how our resulting length and depth calculations are being
affected. Going forward, this simulator will serve as a foundation for corrective
methods, with the ultimate goal of eliminating the need for a corrective optic. The
mathematical derivations and use of each file can be found in the pdf linked below:
